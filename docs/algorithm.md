L < Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes

while there are unmarked nodes do
	select an unmarked node n
	visit(n) 

function visit(node n)
	if n has a temporary mark then stop (not a DAG)
	if n is not marked (i.e. has not been visited yet) then
		mark n temporarily
		for each node m with an edge from n to m do
			visit(m)
		mark n permanently
		unmark n temporarily
		add n to head of L
